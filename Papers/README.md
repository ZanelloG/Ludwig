- **Abstract:**  
  This article investigates the epistemological implications of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence through the philosophical framework of Ludwig Wittgenstein. The Tractatus is revisited in light of symbolic computation and vector-based cognition.

### *A Logical Degeneration of Vector Symbolic Architectures for Explainable AI*
- **Author:** GiosuÃ¨ Zanello  
- **Journal:** Not yet published  
- **Status:** Seeking publication  
- **License:** [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)  
- **Abstract:**  
  This paper proposes a framework for explainable AI by mapping operations in high-dimensional vector spaces (as in VSA systems) to propositional logic. Inspired by Wittgensteinâ€™s *Tractatus*, it introduces a logical degeneration process that preserves symbolic transparency while collapsing distributed complexity.
